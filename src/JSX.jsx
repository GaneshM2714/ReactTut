            JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It's a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code inside your JavaScript files. This makes it easier to create and maintain React components, as you can see the structure of your component right in the code.
JSX is not required to use React, but it is highly recommended. It makes the code more readable and easier to write, and it also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.
